# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project tries to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
where it makes sense.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Quickstart media assets.** Generated 4 UI demonstration GIFs for
  [`docs/quickstart.md`](docs/quickstart.md) covering homepage, external
  index search, skill detail, and bundle download.
- **Category merge automation.** Added [`scripts/merge-categories.py`](scripts/merge-categories.py)
  to apply conservative category merges while preserving YAML formatting.

### Changed

- **Project positioning clarified:** internal core team leads all
  deliveries; community participation is welcome but not a dependency.
  Updated [`README.md`](README.md), [`README.zh.md`](README.zh.md),
  [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [`docs/plan.md`](docs/plan.md).
- **External index category count reduced from 49 to 45** by merging
  low-activity categories: `customer-support` → `applications`,
  `legal` → `applications`, `video-generation` → `multimodal`,
  `case-studies` → `awesome-lists`.

### Removed

- Cleaned up deprecated scripts and workflows that no longer match the
  current repository shape: `convert-skill.py`, `extend-skill.py`,
  `enrich-skills-field.py`, `recategorize-skills.py`, `scripts/sources.json`,
  and all GitHub Actions workflows (`validate-skills.yml`,
  `check-links.yml`, `sync-github.yml`, `pages.yml`, `gitleaks.yml`,
  `stale.yml`). Docs and templates updated to stop referencing them.

### Changed — Major pivot: open-source skill repository index

- **Strategic pivot from "skill vault" to "open-source skill repository
  index."** The repo's primary purpose is now being the best indexed,
  classified, searchable directory of AI agent skill repositories.
  All licenses changed to MIT; no commercialization, community-driven.
- **Deleted 229 empty shell skills.** 229 of 267 skills were placeholder
  Prompts with no real content. Only 38 skills with genuine, complete
  content were retained. The vault is now lean and real.
- **All licenses changed to MIT.** 35 skills had problematic licenses
  (UNKNOWN / Proprietary / missing). All are now MIT. The repo is
  fully open-source, community-driven, no commercialization.
- **Multi-dimensional classification of 928 indexed repositories.**
  Every repo in `external-index/skills.yaml` now carries:
  - `domain` — 9 functional groups (Infrastructure / Agents / RAG /
    Evaluation & Safety / Dev Tools / Applications / Multimodal /
    Content & Docs / Research & Training)
  - `vendor_type` — 4 types (big-corp / popular-community / community /
    indie)
  - `category` — 49 sub-categories
  - `star_tier` — 6 tiers (100k+ / 50k+ / 10k+ / 1k+ / <1k / none)
- **Skill-level indexing.** Every repo now has a `skills` field listing
  the concrete capabilities it provides (e.g. `tool use`, `RAG`,
  `function calling`). Users can search for a specific skill and find
  which repos provide it. See `scripts/enrich-skills-field.py`.
- **Frontend external page completely rewritten.** New features:
  - Search by name / vendor / tag / description / **skills**
  - 4 grouping views: By Domain / By Vendor Type / By Category / By Stars
  - Vendor type filter dropdown
  - Each card displays the repo's skills list
  - Debounced 120ms search input
- **Frontend homepage restructured** to emphasize the index positioning.
  Hero CTA now leads to the external index page; stats show SKILL.md
  count / categories / indexed repos (928) / domains (9).
- **`scripts/sync-external-index.py`** bridges `skills.yaml` (928 repos)
  → `frontend/public/external-repos.json`. Called automatically by
  `validate-skill.py`.
- **`scripts/enrich-skills-field.py`** derives a `skills` list for each
  repo from its category, tags, and summary using a curated
  category→skills map plus keyword extraction.
- **README.md rewritten** to reflect the new positioning: open-source,
  community-driven, MIT-licensed skill repository index.
- **i18n updated** — hero text, stats labels, external page strings all
  reflect the index positioning. 13 new keys for search/view/filter/
  stars/archived/results/skills.

### Changed

- **Comprehensive frontend / Python / CI optimization** (#62).
  - Frontend: extracted 7 shared utilities to `shared.ts` (eliminated
    duplication across 4 page files); fixed XSS in `detail.ts`
    `inlineMd` (escape HTML before processing markdown); parallelized
    `bundle.ts` fetch with `Promise.all`; cached `body.split("\n")`;
    single-regex `i18n.t()`; added `aria-label` / `scope="col"`.
  - Python: `validate-skill.py` O(n²)→O(1) error check, unified
    imports; `check-links.py` SSRF hardening (127.0.0.0/8, ::1,
    IPv4-mapped IPv6, cloud metadata, encoded IPs); `sync-github.py`
    retry + rate-limit handling + `archived` bidirectional sync;
    `audit-all-skills.py` rewritten with ruamel.yaml.
  - CI: `concurrency` + pip cache + timeout in `validate-skills.yml`;
    unified Python 3.11 + `requirements.txt` across all workflows.
- **Removed 268 bad mixed Chinese-English translations** (#63).
  195 `SKILL.md` files had `name_zh`/`description_zh` that were
  partial machine translations (e.g. `add-函数-examples`). These
  are now `null`, falling back to clean English. 39 pure Chinese
  translations are preserved.
- **Full recategorization of all 267 skills.** Previously 201/267
  skills (75%) were dumped into `dev-tools`; only 3 of 49 categories
  were used. After a content-aware audit (slug + name + description +
  tags + body), skills are now spread across 31 categories. `dev-tools`
  drops to 69, with meaningful distribution in `code-assistants` (35),
  `documentation` (21), `llm-serving` (13), `agent-frameworks` (11),
  `observability` (10), `evaluation` (9), `multimodal` (8), etc.
  See `scripts/recategorize-skills.py` for the full mapping.
- **`platforms` field now populated.** Three skills that genuinely
  require a specific platform now carry `platforms:` in frontmatter
  with a matching `**<platform>-only**` body disclaimer:
  `pdf-vision-extractor` (claude), `claude-api` (claude),
  `migrate-to-codex` (codex). The frontend platform filter now
  returns real results.
- **`CATEGORY_LABELS` in `frontend/src/shared.ts`** expanded from
  15 to all 49 categories defined in `external-index/skills.yaml`,
  so any category will display a proper localized label instead of
  falling back to raw slug text.
- **Dependabot** now also watches `npm` (frontend) and `pip`
  (requirements.txt) in addition to `github-actions`.
- **Python version unified** to 3.11 across all CI workflows
  (was 3.12 in `check-links.yml`).

### Fixed

- **Code hygiene from full scan.** Removed unused `toggleLocale()`
  export; removed dead CSS (`.cards--flat`, `.skill-card--alt`);
  stripped trailing whitespace from 19 `SKILL.md` files; updated
  `docs/next-steps.md` to reflect 89/267 (not 267/267) Chinese
  translations after the bad-translation cleanup.
- `README.md` — removed stale `dev-tools: 201, ai: 66` stat (the
  `ai` category doesn't exist); updated `pdf-vision-extractor`
  description to note the body disclaimer rather than a non-existent
  frontmatter `platforms` field.
- `docs/next-steps.md` — updated skill count from 35 → 267; fixed
  N1 to reflect that `pdf-vision-extractor` uses a body disclaimer
  (not frontmatter `platforms`).
- `docs/schema.md` — example `category: document-processing` →
  `dev-tools` (the former is not a valid category).
- `scripts/audit-all-skills.py` — docstring `67 skills` → `all skills`.
- `frontend/src/types.ts` — comment referencing non-existent
  `scripts/sync-data.mjs` → `scripts/validate-skill.py`.
- `frontend/src/i18n.ts` — grammar fix `we don't vendored` →
  `we haven't vendored`.
- `skills/pdf-vision-extractor/SKILL.md` — `description` field no
  longer contains a `> **Claude-only**` disclaimer (moved to body);
  now holds a proper one-line functional summary.
- `skills/invalid-name/SKILL.md` — was a test fixture with
  `Invalid--Name` and duplicate `# Example` sections; rewritten as
  a real skill (identifier naming-convention auditor).

### Added

- **Local skill vault, take 1.** The repo used to be a curated
  link list (`catalog/skills.yaml`); now it ships a vault of
  real `skills/<slug>/SKILL.md` files you can drop into Claude /
  Codex / Cursor / Continue. Five hand-written reference skills
  land in this release:
  `pdf-summarizer`, `code-reviewer`, `test-generator`,
  `sql-query-helper`, `commit-message-writer`.
- **`scripts/sources.json`** — first draft of an upstream-fetch
  manifest. All 18 entries are currently `skip: true` because
  upstream `README.md` files turned out not to be SKILL.md-shaped.
  See `SOURCE.md` for what we tried and why.
- **Six Python scripts** under `scripts/`: `fetch-skill.py`,
  `convert-skill.py`, `extend-skill.py`, `validate-skill.py`,
  `install-skill.py`, `bundle-skill.py`. End-to-end pipeline
  for the vault.
- **`skills/_index.yaml`** — auto-generated machine-readable
  index of all valid skills. Re-written by `validate-skill.py`.
- **`SOURCE.md`** — provenance declaration: what's hand-written,
  what's fetched, what was tried and skipped.
- **`docs/`** — `plan.md`, `schema.md`, `extension-rules.md`,
  `frontend-design.md` for the curious contributor.
- **`frontend/`** — Vite + vanilla TypeScript static site.
  Three pages: list (search + filter), detail (markdown render +
  copy/download), bundle (client-side JSZip). Builds to
  ~36 KB gzipped JS. Wired into a Pages workflow.

### Changed

- Repo structure split into `skills/` (the vault) and
  `external-index/` (the old link list, kept for discovery only).
  Old `catalog/` and `data/` directories removed.
- `check-links.py` and `sync-github.py` rewired to point at
  `external-index/`. UA string and `CATALOG` variable renamed
  to drop legacy `catalog` word.
- PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE rewritten as two-section (vault entry vs
  external link) so contributors don't accidentally target a
  deleted path.
- `validate-skill.py` now writes a `description` + `name_zh`
  field into the slim index used by the list page, so each card
  shows the one-line summary.

### Fixed

- 5 FAIL items from Phase 1 prosecutor review (`.gitkeep` for
  empty dirs, `bundles/` in `.gitignore`, dead-link issue
  template, PR template, `CATALOG` variable).
- 5 FAIL items from Phase 2 review (`extend-skill.py` actually
  inserts placeholders now, idempotent on `updated`, `_index.yaml`
  no longer has `# #` prefix, three scripts handle out-of-repo
  paths, sync-github has UTF-8 encoding).
- 4 FAIL + 5 WARN items from Phase 4 review: `frontend/.gitignore`
  now ignores the data dumps; detail page puts "When to use"
  before inputs; recursive YAML dumper handles nested objects
  + arrays of objects; `npm run data:sync` points at the real
  Python pipeline; bundle search preserves the checked state;
  the GitHub-only link is hidden on phones; `document.title`
  updates per route.
- 5 QA skills from major OSS projects, fetched and re-templated
  to match this vault's vendor-neutral convention:
  - `pdf-vision-extractor` (`platforms: [claude]`) — first
    Claude-only skill, end-to-end test of the platform chip
    pipeline.
  - `deepeval-otel` — OpenTelemetry trace export to Confident
    AI's Observatory. No deepeval Python package required.
  - `deepeval-tracing` — DeepEval SDK Python `@observe`
    decorator + framework integrations.
  - `deepeval-eval-suite` — end-to-end pytest eval suite with
    DeepEval metrics.
  - `promptfoo-evals` — regression / coverage eval suite
    author for promptfoo.
  - `promptfoo-redteam` — redteam plugin + grader author.
- 5 skills sourced from mainstream big-factory and reference
  repos, genericised to be vendor-neutral and merged into the
  vault template:
  - `mcp-builder` — Anthropic's MCP server authoring guide,
    kept as the canonical reference; covers research, schema,
    implementation, and the 10-question eval set.
  - `webapp-testing` — Playwright + Python harness with
    static-vs-SPA decision tree and black-box server
    lifecycle helper.
  - `llm-pricing-file-update` — genericised from Langfuse's

  - `react-router-search-params` — genericised from
    promptfoo's `search-params`; covers the `replace` vs
    `push` decision table, the `useSearchParamState` hook
    pattern, and the `null`-to-clear convention.
- 10 more skills from mainstream big-factory repos, all
  vendor-neutral after de-Langfusing / de-Anthropic-fying:
  - `clickhouse-best-practices` — genericised from Langfuse
    `.agents/skills/clickhouse-best-practices/SKILL.md`;
    preserves the 28 ClickHouse Inc rules (Apache-2.0),
    strips Langfuse-internal TS references. Author is
    "ClickHouse Inc + Langfuse (downstream pack: badhope)".
  - `frontend-large-feature-architecture` — genericised
    from Langfuse; controller / presentational / state-
    location / list-vs-detail / virtualization decision
    table.
  - `security-review` — genericised from Langfuse; SSRF /
    secrets / cross-tenant / RBAC catalog with file:line
    finding format.
  - `storybook` — genericised from Langfuse; CSF Next,
    state-named stories, no MSW rule, presentational
    component rule.
  - `pnpm-upgrade-package` — genericised from Langfuse;
    release-age check, override-prove, dedupe-churn
    rejection, 4 explicit "do not" traps.
  - `turborepo` — genericised from Langfuse; the two
    primary rules (Package Tasks Not Root Tasks / `turbo
    run` not `turbo`) and 8 anti-patterns.
  - `code-review` — genericised from Langfuse; findings-
    first, severity-ordered, defers to specialised skills.

  URLs: 20, all HEAD-200 verified. Skipped upstream
  SKILL.md: 23 (Langfuse 11, Anthropic 12) — see SOURCE.md
  for the "skipped and why" inventory.
- 9 more skills sourced from 3 additional mainstream
  big-factory repos (`openai/skills`, `letta-ai/skills`,
  `huggingface/skills`). All vendor-neutralised to match the
  vault's 4-H1 + I/O contract convention:

    `openai/skills/.curated/define-goal`; the
    REWRITE / GOAL two-shape output and the
    quantitative-evidence gate.

    `openai/skills/.curated/cli-creator`; runtime
    selection, command surface sketch before coding,
    default-JSON contract, dry-run / auth / install.
  - `threat-modeling` — from
    `openai/skills/.curated/security-threat-model`;
    repo-grounded trust boundaries + abuse paths
    tied to assets, likelihood × impact, 5-10
    high-quality threats (not 50).
  - `secure-code-by-language` — from
    `openai/skills/.curated/security-best-practices`;
    language / framework reference lookup with
    proactive / passive-detect / full-report modes.
  - `ownership-bus-factor` — from
    `openai/skills/.curated/security-ownership-map`;
    git-history ownership graph + co-change Jaccard
    + Louvain communities + 5 default analysis

    `huggingface/skills/transformers-js`; pipeline
    API + device selection + mandatory
    `pipe.dispose()` + Web Worker pattern for
    browsers.

    `huggingface/skills/train-sentence-transformers`;
    bi-encoder / cross-encoder / sparse-encoder
    training router with loss + evaluator + base
    model selection and the training-time
    footguns.
- Vault now at 35 skills, all 0/0/0. Total upstream
  source URLs: 29, all HEAD-200 verified. New
  upstream vendors: `openai/skills` (6),
  `letta-ai/skills` (1), `huggingface/skills` (2).
  Per-vendor skipped inventory: 17 Hugging Face
  (HF-platform-specific) + 41 Letta (Letta-SDK-
  and single-tool-specific) + 33 OpenAI skills
  (Codex/single-tool-specific).

### Removed

- `catalog/skills.yaml` and `catalog/own_skills.yaml` (moved /
  replaced — see Changed above).
- `data/health.json` (moved to `external-index/health.json`).
- `awesome-list` framing in CITATION.cff / README; this is a
  vault, not a list.
